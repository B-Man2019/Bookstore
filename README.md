# Library
An example repository for a library written in Java that utilizes Firestore for database integration

## What I learned
I learned more about:
- Types in Java
- Promises and code blocking
- Databases and networking through the cloud
- Managing code through GitHub and Git

## Quickstart
1. Create a new Project in Firebase
2. Get the private key and put it into the root project directory
3. Rename it to `FirebaseServiceKey.json`
4. If using the emulator, download the Firebase CLI and switch the `DEBUG` flag in `Main.java` to `true`
